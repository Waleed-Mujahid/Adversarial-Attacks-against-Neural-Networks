# Adversarial-Attacks-against-Neural-Networks
In this repository I give a brief introduction to the topic.
I also generate some adversarial examples using Fast gradient sign method. Then I use those images to attack a trained network.
Lastly I use adversarial examples generated for one neural network to attack another neural network. This is used to show that adversarial attacks 
are transferable from one network to another
